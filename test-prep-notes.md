# COMPTIA (ITF) IT Fundamentals

- NIC stands for "Network Interface Card" or "Network Interface Controller." A NIC is a hardware component that allows computers to connect to a network and communicate with other devices. It is sometimes referred to as a network adapter or LAN (Local Area Network) adapter.
- Cellular networks give you the best mobility, with a range of up to several miles
- Parallel ports became synonymous with printers in the 1990s
- Solid-state drives (SSDs) do not have internal moving parts
- A patent signifies ownership of an invention for a limited time.
- Accounting on a network tracks what users do. The administrator can use logs or web browser history to do this.
- It’s a **float** data type, which is a number with a decimal place.
- **binary** true or false
- **integer** whole number
- Software product keys are typically included on the package in which the installation CD-ROM was shipped. If the software was downloaded, then the manufacturer usually sends the software key via email.
- A primary key is one or more fields whose data is used to uniquely identify a record.
- Functions and methods are used to break code into small, reusable segments.
- *Metadata* is information about the file, such as its name, size, creator, and security
- Extensible Markup Language (XML) is an example of a markup language
- another primary markup language is Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)
- *Troubleshooting with a macOS* When you receive the prohibition icon, it means that there has been a system failure of some sort (usually not related to the hard drive). Search for the error code online to understand what could be causing the problem.
- A network interface card (NIC) lets your computer participate on a network, either wired or wireless. * this type of expansion card allows your computer to talk to other computers without wires.
- Modems require telephone lines
- PSU is a power supply unit
- PCIe is an expansion slot
- conventional hard disk drives (HHDs) have moving internal parts. 
- PATA and SATA are hard drive connectors
- A **patent** signifies ownership of an invention for a limited time. It can be a machine, process, formula, or product.
- Functions and methods are used to break code into small, reusable segments.
- RJ-11 connectors are on the ends of phone lines, which connect to modems. The fastest modems produced had speeds of 56Kbps
- **Nonrepudiation** is making it so that someone can’t deny that an event happened. Usually this includes video, biometrics, signatures, or receipts. Least privilege model is an authorization concept, and software tokens are an authentication factor.
- Examples of **availability threats** include denial of service, power outage, hardware failure, destruction, and service outage.
- Arrays have a fixed length
-  vectors can have a dynamically allocated length
- relational databases include structured data, predictable and organized with columns and rows of numberical text or data. 
- **script blocker** When you click the Submit button, nothing happens. *When you click a button on a web page, it activates a script telling the page and the server how to react. If scripts are blocked, then the button will not work properly.* 
- Word processing software, spreadsheet software, presentation software, web browsers, and visual diagramming software are examples of **productivity software**.
- **Social engineering** occurs when attackers ask people for information to help them gain access to sensitive information. Examples of this are shoulder surfing and phishing.
- A solid-state drive *(SSD)* will provide *faster bootup times* than a conventional hard disk drive (HDD).
- Twisted-pair network cables are terminated with RJ-45 connectors
- The framework for access control is AAA—authentication, authorization, and accounting. Nonrepudiation is added, which makes it so people can’t deny that an event took place
- **Quality of Service (QoS)** is a strategy that allows an administrator to control resources to maintain a certain service level. By using QoS, an administrator can set different priorities for one or more types of network traffic based on different applications, data flows, or users
- RJ-11 - 56 Kbps
- RJ-45 - twisted pair network cables
- Examples of availability threats include denial of service, power outage, hardware failure, destruction, and service outage.
- Arrays and vectors are the two container types. Arrays have a fixed length, and vectors can have a dynamically allocated length.
- guaranteed bandwith? QoS
- DNS servers resolve host names to IP addresses 
- Biometrics and a one-time password are examples of authentication factors
- Dual inline memory modules (DIMMs) can use 240-pin connectors (and other sizes too). 
- A 64-bit processor can handle 32-bit or 64-bit OSs. It is a waste of power to use a 32-bit OS on it, but it will work
- ried components are most likely due to a power supply problem; therefore, the PSU is likely the culprit. 
- Multifunctional printers and touchscreens are input and output devices. 
- Webcams are input and CRTs are monitors, so they are output only.
