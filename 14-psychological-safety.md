Q: Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.
A: One professional setting I have endured was not safe psychologically. My peers and I had a direct NCO that was dealing with some personal difficulties that seemed to overwhelm the NCO to the point of her lashing out in several ways. We endured a hostile working environment in addition to some personal attacks on some of the Marines. Ultimately the leadership found out and respectfully addressed all issues. The NCO was then moved to a separate section where she was able to reflect, hold herself accountable and flourish among a new group of people.
